Snake Game Description

I created a Snake game in Python using the Turtle library. This classic game, well-known for its simplicity and engaging nature, offers players the opportunity to control a snake in a two-dimensional environment while trying to eat fruits to grow in size. The main objective is to achieve the highest possible score without the snake hitting the screen borders or its own tail.

Main Features:
- **Simple and attractive graphics:** The Turtle library provides easy-to-use graphics, allowing the game elements to be drawn clearly and concisely.
- **Intuitive control:** The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard, offering a smooth and accessible gaming experience.
- **Real-time scoring:** The score is displayed on the screen, encouraging players to improve their performance with each game session.
- **Increasing difficulty:** As the snake eats fruits and grows in length, the game becomes progressively more challenging, requiring quick reflexes and coordination.

 Technical Features:
- **Collision detection:** The game includes collision detection mechanisms to check if the snake has hit the walls or its own tail, which results in the end of the game.
- **Random fruit generation:** Fruits appear at random locations on the map, adding an element of unpredictability and extra challenge.
- **Real-time updates:** Using the functions of the Turtle library, the game updates the positions of the snake and fruits in real-time, ensuring a continuous and uninterrupted gaming experience.

This Snake game created with the Turtle library is perfect for those who want to practice their Python programming skills while having fun at the same time!
